Exercise 1:
The time module provides a function called time, that returns the number of seconds since the
"unix epoch," which is january 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC

Exercise 2
if you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triange. 
for example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are 1 inch long
you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. for any three lengths there
is a test to see if it is possible to form a triangle
    if any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, than you CANNOT
    form a triange. otherwise you can.

write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and prints
yes or no depending on whether or not you can form a triangle from the sticks with the given lenghts
    Hing: use a chained conditional

What do I think it does:
I see it calls itself and multiplies the length by the factor,
which will reduce the size of length,
I think it will draw a spiral, just making a guess.
it actually makes a fractal shape., I should have infered this because
the function is recursive and once it has gone through the recursion, it goes back to a starting point

Exercise 4:
Draw a Koch curve with length x, doing these:
    1. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3
    2. Turn left 60 degrees
    3. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3
    4. Turn right 120 Degrees
    5. Draw a koch curve with length x/3
    6. Turn left 60 degrees
    7. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3

    The exception is if x is less than 5, in that case you can just draw a straight line
